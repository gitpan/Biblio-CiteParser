TODO
====

This is a fairly informal list of things I'd like to add:

- Check over documentation

- Model a reference as an object (ParaTools::Reference). This would
  be returned by the parsers, and perhaps have methods like 'toOpenURL',
  etc. This would allow for changes in metadata in future, too.

- Check over foreign character support.
